# concepts-manual
This is a repo holding the LaTeX and markdown documents containing the manual for the tool Plato.

Plato is a tool which implements a domain-specific language for concepts, as well as a tool for translating
concepts to Signal Transition Graphs, and Finite State Machines, graph-modelling formalisms more commonly
used which can be used with several existing tools for verification and synthesis. 

Plato can be found at [github.com/tuura/plato](https://github.com/tuura/plato), and the manual relavent to
that version is included in both PDF and markdown formats. It is also included with [Workcraft](https://workcraft.org)
where it is integrated into it's GUI platform, using Plato as a back end tool.
